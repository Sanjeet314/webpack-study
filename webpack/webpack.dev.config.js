//When using webpack-dev-server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), the page does not fully reload. Instead, HMR allows you to update specific modules at runtime without requiring a complete page refresh
//When a change is detected in a module (e.g., a file like print.js), the HMR runtime notifies webpack.
//Webpack then updates the affected module without a full page reload.
//If the HMR update fails, the entire page will be reloaded.
